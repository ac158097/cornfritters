# Corn Fritters

## Ingredients
- 1/2 Can creamed corn
- 1 Egg
- 1/2 Cup self-raising flour (might have to add more)

## Method
1. Mix all ingredients together. Take care and do not over mix as this will toughen the fritters.
2. Heat a fry pan over a medium heat. Add a little oil or margarine.
3. Add spoonfuls of mixture and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown. Turn down the heat a little if the fritters cook too quickly and start to burn.
